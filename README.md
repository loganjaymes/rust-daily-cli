# About
A daily to-do list CLI app.

# Why?
On my journey of teaching myself Rust through The Rust Programming Language, Rust By Example, and supplemental YouTube videos, I wanted to create a CLI app that uses the fundamentals of any programming language; that is, control flow, file I/O, data structures, etc. </br>
CLI apps are a common type of lab I've done while in my university's earlier courses, so I thought creating one in a language I was unfamiliar with would be good practice to create something useful (as opposed to making 3210948321 temporary `new.txt`s in Notepad++), while simultaneously getting my hands dirty in the language (and, of course, the borrow checker). 

# Reflection (ongoing)
What I thought would be a small one or two day project has taken me longer than I expected. I underestimated how strict Rust's compiler *actually* is, as well as how verbose the syntax is (although this is for good reason as laid out in The Book). As of writing (12/23/2025), I am still not finished with the project :[. </br>
I have one or two more functionalities to implement, and then a ***lot*** of refactoring to do. </br>
I will say though, developing this small project has made me think about a lot of things that I had never considered while programming in Python or C++ (such as design choices revolving around typing, scopes, etc.). The main insight I've taken away from this project is that now, I've definitely gotten a better grasp on borrowing and ownership.
